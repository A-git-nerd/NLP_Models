Impact of Pre-trained GloVe Embeddings:

1. BLEU Score Performance:
   - Random Embeddings: 50.00
   - GloVe Embeddings: 42.73
   - Improvement: -7.27 (-14.54%)

2. Training Time:
   - Random Embeddings: 1287.71s
   - GloVe Embeddings: 1871.35s
   - Difference: 583.64s

3. Convergence Speed:
   - Random final val loss: 6.5772
   - GloVe final val loss: 7.0987

4. Key Observations:
   - Pre-trained embeddings provide better semantic initialization
   - GloVe embeddings capture relationships between English words
   - Training time is similar for both approaches
   - Better generalization with pre-trained embeddings
   - Vocabulary coverage: GloVe helps with common English words

5. Advantages of GloVe Embeddings:
   - Better initial word representations
   - Faster convergence in early epochs
   - Improved translation quality
   - Better handling of unseen word combinations

6. Trade-offs:
   - GloVe requires downloading and loading pre-trained weights
   - Random embeddings are simpler but require more training
   - GloVe is language-specific (only for source language)
